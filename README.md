# Scrambled Word Guessing Game

The program randomly picks a word from a given txt file, scrambles it, and asks the user to guess it. There is also an option to show the Chinese meaning of the scrambled word as additional hint (if provided in txt file). The program also calculates your accuracy based on your correct guesses. 

Your progress is automatically saved after each guess.
